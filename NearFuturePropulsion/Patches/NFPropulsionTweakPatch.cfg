//  Near Future Propulsion Tweak Patch, by Streetwind
//
//
//
//  This file is meant to provide a simple means of changing engine performance without having to write your own patch.
//
//  Some users will know what the code below means. Some users will stare blankly at it and not understand a thing.
//  If you belong to the first group, go ahead and do as you please!
//  If you belong to the second group, fear not! Just pick a chapter and follow the guide.
// 
//
//
//  Chapter 1 - "Why do these engines use so much power?!"
// 
//  If you want to change how much power the engines consume, while leaving everything else the same, you need to modify:
//  - all of the things named "ratio" (there's two of them)
//  - all of the things named "EnergyUsage" (there's one of them)
//  - everything inside the brackets of "PowerCurve" (that's two things)
//
//  Verify you can find all of these five elements in the code below. Then, replace their "1.0" numbers with a value of your own.
//  If you choose 1.5, the engines will consume 33% less power. if you choose 2.0, the engines will consume 50% less power. And so on.
//  It also works the other way around... if you choose 0.5, the engines will consume twice as much power.
//
//  It is important that you input the same number for ALL FIVE elements! Else weird things may happen.
//
//
//
//  Chapter 2 - "The amount of thrust these engines put out is unrealistic/too high/too low!"
//
//  If you want to change how much thrust the engines provide, while leaving everything else the same, you need to modify:
//  - all of the things named "ratio" (there's two of them)
//  - all of the things that have the word "thrust" in them (there's seven of them)
//
//  Verify you can find all of these nine elements in the code below. Then, replace their "1.0" numbers with a value of your own.
//  If you choose 0.9, the engines will produce 10% less thrust. if you choose 0.8, the engines will produce 20% less thrust. And so on.
//  It also works the other way around... if you choose 1.5, the engines will produce 50% more thrust.
//
//  It is important that you input the same number for ALL NINE elements! Else weird things may happen.
//
//
//
//  Chapter 3 - "I am dissatisfied with the Isp values you guys have chosen!"
//
//  If you want to change the specific impulse of the engines, while leaving everything else the same, you need to modify:
//  - all of the things named "ratio" (there's two of them)
//  - everything inside the brackets of "atmosphereCurve" (that's four things)
//  - everything inside the brackets of "IspCurve" (that's two things)
//  - the four things at the bottom of "VariableISPEngine"
//
//  Verify you can find all of these twelve elements in the code below. Then, replace their "1.0" numbers with a value of your own.
//  If you choose 0.9, the engines will give you 11% more dV. If you choose 0.8, the engines will give you 25% more dV. And so on.
//  It also works the other way around... if you choose 1.5, the engines will give you 33% less dV.
//
//  It is important that you input the same number for ALL TWELVE elements! Else weird things may happen.
//
//
//
//  Chapter 4 - "I want to apply tweaks from multiple chapters at the same time!"
//
//  This can get complicated. The best way to do this is to apply chapters one by one, starting with the one with the most changes.
//  For example, to combine chapters 2 and 3, start with applying chapter 3 first. Don't make any chapter 2 changes until that's done.
//  Then, apply the changes from chapter 2 that don't conflict with chapter 3. That would be the thrust settings.
//  You're left, in the end, with the task of changing the ratios for chapter 2, but you already changed them for chapter 3.
//  Here, you need to do multiplication. Let's assume the ratios are currently set to 1.5, and you changed thrust to be 0.5.
//  1.5 x 0.5 = 0.75. Therefore, you replace all ratios with 0.75. That value is the combination of both changes you are trying to make.
//
//
//
//  Chapter 5 - "I want to change individual engines in different ways!"
//
//  This file, when used as intended, maintains the pre-set balance between the different engines in the pack.
//  It changes the performance of all its electric engines, as well as the stock Dawn engine, in the same proportional ways.
//  If you want to break up this balance, this file will not be of much help. You will have to write your own patches.
//
//
//
//  Chapter 6 - "How can I change other engine parameters, like heat, cost, mass, and so on?"
//
//  That is not a feature of this simple tweak file. You will have to write your own patches.
//
