This is a showcase mod for RasterPropMonitor which adds a useful information 
display to certain stock and mod capsules. This is also the canonical source of
RasterPropMonitor.dll plugin and associated files.

If the plugin was listed as a dependency by some other mod author, the 
"JSI/RPMPodPatches" directory may be safely deleted. Every capsule being
modified has it's own pair of patch config files -- you can
safely delete only those you don't want.
