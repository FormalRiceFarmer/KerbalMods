    description = This enormous dual-mode engine was engineered for missions with extremely heavy payloads such as delivering HX modules to orbit or powering interplanetary transfers of structures exceeding thousands of tonnes. It combines the performance of a traditional closed-cycle rocket engine and that of a nuclear-powered LV-N engine in one propulsion assembly. The tech behind it is unclear and Tetragon Projects has declined to respond to inquiries, but it appears to use electromagnetic fields to direct and accelerate exhaust gases. The primary mode uses relatively small amounts of power supplied by dedicated gas generators, while secondary mode draws enormous amounts of power, which must be supplied externally - likely by the HX-URC Reactor, designed for this purpose. Note that the secondary mode is not designed to be run at full throttle continuously, and the HX-URC18 has been designed appropriately. Attempts to power it with solar panel arrays, though technically possible, have so far been unsuccessful.
